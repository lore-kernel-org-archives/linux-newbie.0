Sorry, I'm not much of a linux assembly guru, but I am wondering why you 
assume the Makefile is the problem.  It could be, I'm not a makefile 
guru either.  But, as far as I know, make works the same no matter what 
kernel it's running on.  My first suspicion would be that calling 
conventions were changed between kernel versions, or that you use a 
kernel function that changed functionality.  Also, the version of gcc 
may be important.  I think something in the 2.9xx series is recommended 
for compiling the kernel.
