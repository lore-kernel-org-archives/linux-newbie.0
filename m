Architecture provides minimum atomicity in the form of assembly
instructions.So below is the code of how in arm atomic_add() is
implemented which is SMP safe,
/*
 * ARMv6 UP and SMP safe atomic ops.  We use load exclusive and
 * store exclusive to ensure that these are atomic.  We may loop
 * to ensure that the update happens.
 */
static inline void atomic_add(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
         __asm__ __volatile__("@ atomic_add\n"
"1:     ldrex   %0, [%3]\n"
"       add     %0, %0, %4\n"
"       strex   %1, %0, [%3]\n"
"       teq     %1, #0\n"
"       bne     1b"
        : "=&r" (result), "=&r" (tmp), "+Qo" (v->counter)
        : "r" (&v->counter), "Ir" (i)
        : "cc");
}

Above function is SMP safe(but sometimes this also needs memory barrier
(/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt-ATOMIC OPERATIONS) and be careful
with the name of the functions as atomic in the function name doesn't
guaranty anything as below:
        CPU 1                        CPU 2
        ===============           ===============
	x = 0;                       y = x;
       atomic_add_return(x)  

what do you think would be the value of y in CPU2?Legally it can have
any value i.e. 0 or 1 as CPU1 can reorder the instructions any time(when
does it see fit to reorder?).However if atomic_add_return is implemented
with explicit memory barriers then it wouldn't happen and you will see a
correct result as below:
        CPU 1                        CPU 2
        ===============           ===============
	x = 0;                       
       atomic_add_return(x)  
				    y  = x;	//x will be 1 here

From arch/arm/include/asm/atomic.h 
static inline int atomic_add_return(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
        smp_mb();  <BARRIER HERE>
        __asm__ __volatile__("@ atomic_add_return\n"
"1:     ldrex   %0, [%3]\n"
"       add     %0, %0, %4\n"
"       strex   %1, %0, [%3]\n"
"       teq     %1, #0\n"
"       bne     1b"
        : "=&r" (result), "=&r" (tmp), "+Qo" (v->counter)
        : "r" (&v->counter), "Ir" (i)
        : "cc");

        smp_mb(); <BARRIER HERE>
}
so atomic variable is just like any other variable except it comes with
some set of operations which combined with barriers make it really
_atomic_.
