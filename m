Your two constraints are actually inter-related -

If you can only feed the HW a constant size chunk, than indeed need to
keey bytes fed
to the driver the are below the chunk size in a software buffer, but
than you need the final()
method to feed these bytes (padded as needed) to the HW if they are
the last bytes
