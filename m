You're using checkpatch --file on a patch. I hope you don't intend your=20
patch to be added to the kernel source as a file, but rather applied to=20
the kernel source, changing other files. (I bet "gcc 0001-Staging*.patch"=20
will get interesting errors, too...) The patch format adds a single=20
character at the beginning of each line to say whether it's a addition, a=20
deletion, or a context line, and the context lines are identified by a=20
space character. This means that a blank context line consists of just=20
this space character, which is therefore a trailing space. We get the same =

type of complaints when we have expected diff output in our test scripts.

I'm kind of surprised that checkpatch doesn't completely blow up when it's =

expecting a source file and getting a patch (and maybe tell you what=20
you've done). But that's the source of your errors, anyway.
