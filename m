Basically you make use of machine specific instructions that will  do
that for you.
In other words, get the datasheets of the specific system you intent
to code on/for (I assume here you are refering to assembler level
codes, as higher up you make use of the relevant libraries that does
that for you).

However, if you refer to the general case: You make use of critical
areas bounded by the necessary lock(s), like semaphores, mutex locks,
doors, message queues etc. that is described in details in several
text books on the subject of concurrency/parallelism/distributed
computing/etc.
