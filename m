If you're going to implement get/set then you need getters and setters
that make sense.  Now, doing something like that might be acceptable as
part of a larger patchset (which is one way to "take smaller bites"),
but the above is just gratuitous obfuscation, since it leaves in place
the ugliest part of it all, which is the magic constant 0x00000100.

Personally, I would be just as happy treating the descriptor as an u64
and explicitly do shifts and masks with well-defined constants.  It's
the magic constants that suck.
