Try to put it higher than the irq thread handling your HD hardware.
I've even encountered hardware where I had to put the ATA thread
in the SHED_OTHER domain - see [1] for the thread.

Which prio is the ksoftirqd running at? The HRTIMER interrupts are
routed through it so it also has to be high enough.

I got burned with this myself [2]
