Not really if they *run*, but if they sleep...

Well, if each group would only take to run as long as it's longest
running member, you'd need the CPU power to run them in parallel.
Threads (or multiple, concurrently running /etc/initd./ scripts) would
need several processors to really run in parallel. If you only have one
CPU, all processes/threads would get time slices to run in.

That is, in theory, their behaviour for *running*. However, init scripts
don't "run" all the time. Some of them actually sleep. Sleeping can even
be parallelized in a good manner with less CPUs than processes, so you
may gain a little speed, but from sleeping-in-parallel, not from
running-in-parallel. On the other hand, you hit the system with greater
memory consumption which, for low-RAM machines, may force you into swap,
which will really make you slow...

Well, threads (on their own) are a great thing iff

	- you've got many (identical) tasks to _do_ in parallel while
	  having about the same number of CPUs.
	- you need to wait for rare events (ie. read from serial
	  interfaces and the like).

Threads in their own don't speed a well-written program up. They even
have the capacity to slow you down (by requiring unneccessary task
switches).

However, I've done a little test with my laptop (P2-266, 128MB RAM).
Groupwise parallelized, taking rc2 (not rcS) takes 5sec, vs. 20sec for
the non-parallelized traversal. But screen output now is even less
readable than before (Ever seen HP-UX starting?)...
