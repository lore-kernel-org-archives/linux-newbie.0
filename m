I don't have the answer. But look at something that already does this.
electric-fence detects illegal memory access (great for debugging)
ccmalloc is also a memory debugging library. It detects memory leaks and 
stuff like that.

Maybe after you checked this out you can rather work on improving these 
library's or extending them to do exactly what you want rather than 
reinventing the weel :-)

Good luck
