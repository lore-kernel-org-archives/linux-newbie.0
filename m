No
Boot scripts _must_ be executed in a predefined order.
I was playing a liitle with this and i can give you the=20
following advice:

1. Bash is the most executed program in the init scripts
to speed up boot process you must speedup bash.
Some people suggest to make statically linked. This is=20
my sugestion too. Loading every shared library takes time.

2. Use a script to start your daemons not 20.=20
I use Slackware which has one script for each runlevel.=20
Believe me. There _is_ a difference compared to Mandrake=20
for example.=20

3. The disk load has an impact on speed also.
If you start 5 processes in parralel they will start slower
than 5 scripts sequentially because of the loading of every
script in the same time.

4. A bigger processor cache also helps a lot :-)

just my 2 cents.

Sorry for the off-topic answer in linux-c-programming
