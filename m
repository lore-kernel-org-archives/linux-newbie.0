I'm trying to write a tracer on memory allocation, and I'm having a little
trouble figuring this out.

At some point, malloc has to call the kernel to tell it to allocate more
memory for this user process, right?  I can't figure out which function
malloc calls, or where in the code (line number) it's called.

I'm looking at glib-2.3.1 to try and find my answers.  After all, that's
where malloc is defined, right?

TIA.
