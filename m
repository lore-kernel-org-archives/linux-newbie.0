Hi,

I am trying to adapt Visual Audio Tool for the TAO( the ACE ORB) framework.
I had tried to communicate the authors of VAT at Berkeley Labs,
unfortunately they are no longer there.

I am trying to run VAT on RH7.2 and I have the following problem


		I loaded the gsm files above the vat directory and the
"configure" produced a "Makefile". However when i run the "make" i have the
following message ....


				In file included from inet.c:33
				config.h:87:conflicting types for
'gethostid'
				/usr/include/unistd.h:805:previous
declaration of "gethostid"
				In file included from inet.c:34
				inet.h:98:redefinition of 'struct msghdr'
				make : *** [inet.o] Error 1

Can somebody give some info on modifying the RTP specific components of VAT
and how to adapt them to the TAO framework. I have a copy of the book
"Pattern Oriented Software Architecture" by Doug Schmidt et.al which deals
with the handles of TAO.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
TIA,
Raj
