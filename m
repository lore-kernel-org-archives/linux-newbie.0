In the Obfuscated C contest one of the first/early entries is one that
states "Using read to write" (Or something to similar extend, or
perhaps even using scanf to print). Reading that code is hackery, and
from my first glance at the code, it was don't with quote and macro
hackery.

Thus you could #define scanf __prinf and #define printf __scanf... or
something with similar confusing
