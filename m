Hello,
	I have an interesting theory. I have beginning programming expereice and 
would like the input of those that have more expereince than me. Please don't 
flame if this is a waste of time. Rather I would like an open discussion on 
the why's and why nots of this.
	Wouldn't the Linux Boot process be speeded up if the init program was 
multithreaded? I know a little about threads.. and I think there might be 
some complication of PPID assignment coming from the threads which would 
probably terminate instead of having a PPID of 1 which is init and will never 
terminate. (i think?). Should init scripts have a parent PID of 1? Does this 
even matter?  
	If I am correct, whenever a programs parent dies, its parent becomes init 
anyways. So when the thread finishes execution of the script, then its parent 
would become init just as if it had started sequentially and directly from 
init.
	The script links in /etc/rc.d/x.d/ would be grouped according to their S and 
K numbers. That is, if you have 5 scripts that are S5, each would be given to 
a thread to execute and there would be 5 threads. The init process would wait 
for each thread to clean up before proceeding to the next group. I know this 
would happen in an undefined order, but if you want, for example, DHCPD to 
start after network then you would assing S5network and S6dhcpd. There would 
still be a defined order for differently numbered scripts, just the bootup 
process wouldnt have to wait for each script to terminate sequentially.
	 Each group would only take as long and the slowest script instead of the sum 
of the execution time of the scripts. The init would start with the S1 
scripts and maybe fork 3 times, wait for each to finish...., then fork maybe 
twice for the S2 group if there are two scripts, wait for them to 
finish...etc....
	Is this even possible?
