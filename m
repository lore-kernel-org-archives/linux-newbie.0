hi joe,
i am not a maintainer here so my comments are my private commonts so ..
1. this is a lot of work and thx for it

patch 2/12:
personaly i am not a fan of typedefs especially like this one:
typedef struct gate_struct gate_desc;
they make people think they move a int or something around that is a fat
struct in real. do you really need a typedef ? or can you live with "struct gate_struct" instead ?

(see: also http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5780 section: typedef Is Evil )

patch 6/12 (same goes for others)
is is possible to be more verbose ? what does l/d/g mean ? maybe an enum ?
+	desc->avl    = flags & 0x1;
+	desc->l      = (flags & 0x2) >> 1;
+	desc->d      = (flags & 0x4) >> 2;
+	desc->g      = (flags & 0x8) >> 3;

i noticed you are accessing hi/lo often. you can use a macro like:

from: highuid.h
#define low_16_bits(x)  ((x) & 0xFFFF)
#define high_16_bits(x) (((x) & 0xFFFF0000) >> 16)

or use a union {
	int foo;
	char bar[4];
	}



keep on going ...
	walter
